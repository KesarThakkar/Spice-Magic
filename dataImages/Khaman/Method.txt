Method:

In a mixing bowl, add gram flour, semolina, yogurt, ginger paste, green chili paste, turmeric powder, sugar, salt, and oil. Mix well.
Add water gradually and whisk to form a smooth batter of pouring consistency. The batter should be thick yet flowing.
Add fruit salt and mix gently. The batter will become frothy and light.
Grease a steamer plate or a thali with oil. Pour the batter in the plate or thali.
Place the plate or thali in a steamer and steam for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Remove the plate or thali from the steamer and let it cool for 5 minutes.
Cut the khaman into pieces and keep aside.
In a small pan, heat oil. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add curry leaves and saut√© for a few seconds.
Pour this tempering over the khaman. Sprinkle chopped coriander leaves and grated coconut (if using) on top.
Serve khaman warm with green chutney or tamarind chutney.
Enjoy your homemade khaman!
