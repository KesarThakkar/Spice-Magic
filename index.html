		    Greetings to all. Welcome to Spice Magic By Kesar! I am Kesar Thakkar, the creator 
			of Spice Magic by Kesar and a 12th-grade student with a passion for cooking. 
			I have always been fascinated by the culinary arts. As a young girl, I  would often
			watch my mother cooking, and I quickly developed an interest in creating my own dishes. 
			I began experimenting with different ingredients and techniques, and my love of
			cooking grew stronger with each passing day.
