       <p>Welcome to Spice Magic By Kesar, a website dedicated to
		share my passion for cooking with you all. My name is Kesar Thakkar 
		and I am a 12th grader with love for creating delicious 
		meals using variety of spices and ingredients.</p>
       
       <p>
            I created this website to share my recipes with others
		who share the same passion for cooking or are looking
		to learn more about it.

             Spice Magic By Kesar offers a wide variety of dishes 
          that are easy to cook. I believe that cooking is not
          just about making food, but also about creativity,
		  experimentation and sharing joy with others.
