            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one 
            of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
            As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
            behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
            to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-
            orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-
            driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
            interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data 
            structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
          </p>
    
          <p>
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core 
            components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime
            system for this usage is Node.js.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
            libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
